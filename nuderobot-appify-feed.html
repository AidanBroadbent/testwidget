I’ve been sitting on this forever.  Started in the summer and then stopped for 4 months.  Lost hope it this pieces potential for a bit but its nice to present it somewhat.  At the time I wasn’t productive so I thought it was a nice ambitious project.  Little did I know how hellish it would become .  I’m like a method animator in that way .  Anyway, it really did deepen my understanding of modeling and projection mapping.  In the end, I gave up modeling a perfect 360. —— Ultimately I could see museums of the future present content (new and old )  like this in AR / VR .  Anyway, I’ll combine this into new pieces in the future .  Enjoy this beautiful display of my masochistic labor.</div></div></a><a href="https://instagram.com/p/Ccz7WC0Jgea"><div class="ig-post"><video src="nuderobot\Ccz7WC0Jgea.mp4" autoplay loop width="100%" height="100%" muted></video><div class="ig-caption">best friends</div></div></a><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CitBcNkvr_3"><div class="ig-post"><img src="nuderobot\CitBcNkvr_3.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/><div class="ig-caption">BTS showing off @tonqart insane skills on the @dondiablo video.  First two slides tonq tracked the camera by hand as well . 😵‍💫 As someone’s who’s pursued hand tracking stuff, @tonqart is on another level.  So fluid and perfect.  Allowed me to perform live on set with no mocap suit.  I did all the simulating and compositing after receiving the tracked avatar.  Video directed by me and @sw33toof</div></div></a><a href="https://instagram.com/p/CibFuR5vFpk"><div class="ig-post"><img src="nuderobot\CibFuR5vFpk.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"/><div class="ig-caption">No Piensa - @dondiablo

I have yet to reveal the crazy part of this video, which is that I performed the cone creature on set - live .  No mocap.  Then the genius @tonqart did manual rotomation over my body - for 12 big scenes .  Plus he hand tracked some impossible scenes.  I’ve never been outtracked before !  This dude is insane !!!

This will be a weekly event that’s we are organizing.  They have been putting in lots of hard work so I’m super honored to join them.  NFTS have become ruined by greed so this is really meaningful for me to participate in. 

Still debating a multi edition or 1x1 - let me know any thoughts.

Will repost again when we are approaching mint date ❣️

Releasing April 7th.

🦋 What is METANOIA? 🦋

 • Created by @JoyOdyssey and @NudeRobot Metanoia is meant to visually capture the change in one's life, as a result of spiritual awakening or transformation. Each piece is accompanied by unique hand-crafted background music, carefully tuned to 432hz, to tap into both visual and auditory senses. 

🦋 What is its mission? 🦋

 • METANOIA is exploration of meditation, ai, and nature.  It furthers my ai pursuit aligned with Carlos intuitive sonic nature.  These pieces are slow and revenant by design.  While it is ai made, the human hand was never far away, as I continue to pursue the intersection of ai and hand made processes.

🦋 What's the mint process? 🦋
